        I'm creating this counter to act as an experiment if you will. The idea
        is to test relay-logic and practice PCB design and soldering on this
        Relay Counter Project, before moving on to build a Relay Computer. I
        might even use this counter in the Relay Computer Project.

        <strong>The Vision:</strong> Create a
        <strong>Tower of Adders</strong> that can combine two 8-bit binary
        numbers to give a 16-bit result. The Adders should be
        <strong>Modular</strong> for the possibility of adding larger numbers in
        the future. <strong>Custom PCB</strong> designs. I want a
        <strong>Decoder Card</strong> I can plug into the Adder Stack that
        decodes the binary and displays numbers most of us can read...

      We start at the most basic counter in binary. Using an AND logic-gate with
      a XOR logic-gate, we can combine them to create a
      <strong>Half-Adder</strong>. The output in this case is the Sum (S) or a
      Carry (C). This Half-Adder takes in 2 inputs (A,B) and adds them. If both
      inputs are 1, the sum should be 0 with the carry to be 1. I won't be
      explaining binary in this project, but you can find all my resources
      <a href="/assets/pages/misc/about.html">here</a>.

    <section>
      Now that we have a Half-Adder we can start counting one bit, but what if
      we need to count 2 bits with the Carry value from the previous sum. This
      is where we create a <strong>Full-Adder</strong>. It is essentially two
      Half-Adders connected with an OR logic-gate to take in 2 input values(A,
      B), and a carry (Cin) and produce the sum (Sum) and a carry value (Cout)

    <section>
      With the Full-Adder done we can chain these together to make the 8-bit
      input for A-input, B-input and combine these for a 16-bit Sum output.
